Dependencies:

- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) <3
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) <3
-  `transformers` for huggingface transformers <3 (to load GPT-2 checkpoints)
-  `datasets` for huggingface datasets <3 (if you want to download + preprocess OpenWebText)
-  `tiktoken` for OpenAI's fast BPE code <3
-  `wandb` for optional logging <3
-  `tqdm` for progress bars <3

## todos

- Investigate and add FSDP instead of DDP
- Eval zero-shot perplexities on standard evals (e.g. LAMBADA? HELM? etc.)
- Finetune the finetuning script, I think the hyperparams are not great
- Schedule for linear batch size increase during training
- Incorporate other embeddings (rotary, alibi)
- Separate out the optim buffers from model params in checkpoints I think
- Additional logging around network health (e.g. gradient clip events, magnitudes)
- Few more investigations around better init etc.
